JPMCB and JPMS (collectively \"J.P. Morgan\") are affiliated companies under the common control of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Important Information about Pricing, Valuations, Estimated Annual Income, and Estimated Yield Market value information (including without limitation, prices, exchange rates, accrued income and bond ratings) furnished herein, some of which has been provided by pricing sources that J.P. Morgan believes to be reliable, is not guaranteed for accuracy but provided for informational purposes and is furnished for the exclusive use of the client. The current price is the value of the financial asset share, unit or contract as priced at the close of the market on the last day of the statement period or the last available price. All values provided for structured yield deposits (for example, JPMorgan London Time Deposits) reflect the original deposit amount only. The value for Real Estate, Mineral Interests and Miscellaneous Assets may not reflect the most current value of the asset. The values in this statement are shown in USD. If your investment currency is not USD, please be aware that the value of your return could differ positively or negatively due to exchange fluctuations from the value shown in this statement. Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are sourced from the various issuers of the securities or they are sourced from a third party valuation provider. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction. Certain assets, including but not limited to, pooled and private investments, non-publicly traded and infrequently traded securities, derivatives, partnership interests and tangible assets are generally illiquid, the value of such asset may have been provided to us by third parties who may or may not be independent of the issuer or manager. Such information is reflected as of the last date provided to us, and is not independently verified. J.P. Morgan makes no representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, that any quoted value represents the actual terms at which securities could be bought or sold or new transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated. Such values may only be indicative. If a partial call is made with respect to an issue of securities included in your Accounts we will allocate the call by a method we deem fair and equitable. CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS THAT MAY APPEAR IN YOUR STATEMENT EAI: Estimated annual income. Actual income could be lower or higher than the estimated amount. Certain types of securities could include a return of principal or capital gains, in which case the EAI would be overstated. EY: Estimated yield. EY reflects only the estimated yield generated by an investment and does not reflect changes in its price, which may fluctuate. Actual yield could be lower or higher than the estimated amount. Certain types of securities could include a return of principal or capital gains, in which case the EY would be overstated.',\n",

Under federal law, deposits that are maintained outside of the United States, including in any JPMCB branch located outside of the United States, are not insured by the FDIC or any other agency of the U.S. Federal Government; are subject to cross-border risks; and enjoy a lesser preference, as compared to deposits held in the United States, in the event JPMCB should be liquidated, become insolvent or be placed into receivership or be subject to other proceedings for the benefit of creditors. Certain Foreign Accounts are considered reportable to FinCEN on Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FinCEN Form 114). JPMCB\\'s London Branch is a participant in the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the \"FSCS\"), and the following terms apply to the extent any of your cash deposits are deposited in one or more deposit accounts at JPMCB\\'s London Branch. Subject to the FSCS rules regarding eligible deposits, you may have a right to claim compensation from the FSCS. The terms of the FSCS offer protection to certain types of claimants to whom JPMCB London Branch provides deposit services in the event that they suffer a financial loss as a direct consequence of JPMCB\\'S London Branch being unable to meet any of its obligations. Subject to the FSCS rules, the maximum compensation payable by the FSCS in relation to eligible deposits is as set out in the relevant information sheet which is available online as referenced below. For the purposes of establishing such maximum compensation, all your eligible deposits at JPMCB London Branch are aggregated and the total is subject to such maximum compensation. For further information about the compensation provided by the FSCS, refer to the FSCS website at www.FSCS.org.uk.

For more complete details, see the applicable account agreements and appendices that govern your account. JPMS, a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corp (\"SIPC\"), provides account protection for the net equity of a customer\\'s funds and securities positions. SIPC provides $500,000 of primary net equity protection, including $250,000 for claims for cash (\"SIPC Coverage\"). You may obtain information about SIPC, including the SIPC Brochure, on their website, at \"www.sipc.org\" or by contacting them at (202) 371-8300. Account protection applies when a SIPC member firm fails financially and is unable to meet its obligations to its securities customers, but does not apply to losses from the rise or fall in the market value of investments or to SIPC ineligible assets such as futures, options on futures, foreign exchange transactions, or any investment contracts that are not registered as securities or deposit account balances.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CALLABLE SECURITIES To the extent J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS LLC) holds on behalf of any introduced customer account securities which, by their terms, may be called or redeemed prior to maturity (\"callable securities\") and a partial call or redemption involving such securities occurs, the following procedures will be followed: JPMS LLC will generally administer the partial call or redemption via an impartial lottery system by which it will allocate among its introduced customers the securities to be selected as called or redeemed. In the event the call or redemption is deemed to be on terms favorable to the applicable holder as determined by JPMS LLC, JPMS LLC shall not allocate the securities to any account in which it or its associated persons (or the associated persons of its introducing brokers, to the extent those accounts have been identified to JPMS LLC by the introducing broker, generally, \"associated persons\") have an interest until all other customers\\' positions in such securities have been satisfied. In the event the call or redemption is deemed to be on terms unfavorable to the applicable holder, as determined by JPMS LLC, the accounts of customers and associated persons will participate in the impartial lottery on equal terms. See https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/EN/disclosures/callable_securities This information supersedes any prior or inconsistent terms relating to callable securities in your account.',\n",
       " \"IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION APPLICABLE ONLY TO YOUR ASSET ACCOUNT(S) (LINKED TO JPMS) You must promptly advise your J.P.Morgan representative of material changes in your investment objectives or financial situation or if you wish to modify the management of your account. Unless you inform otherwise, your J.P.Morgan representative will consider the information currently in its files to be complete and accurate. MARGIN ACCOUNTS: IMPORTANT INFORMATION All positions in your Margin Account Portfolio(s) are held in custody with JPMS. If you have any questions regarding custody of your positions, please write JPMS at 4 Chase Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11245-001, or call (347) 643-2578. If you have a margin account as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in such account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales, and as a result may receive compensation in connection therewith. Securities purchased on margin are the firm's collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, the firm can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with the member, in order to maintain the required equity in the account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following: - You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. - The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s).\",\n",

       " '\\x0cFor the Period 8/1/20 to 8/31/20',\n",
       " '- The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. - You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. - The firm can increase its \"house\" maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice. - You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. Please keep the following in mind when using a statement to track your brokerage activity in a margin account: The statement combines your general margin account with the special memorandum account required by Section 220.6 Regulation T. As required by Regulation T, a permanent record of your separate account is available upon your request. Free credit balances in your Margin Account(s) are not segregated and may be used in the operation of JPMS\\'s business, subject to the limitations of SEC Rule 15c3-3. Unless otherwise noted, JPMS or its agents and depositories will hold your securities. Upon your demand, JPMS will pay to you the amount of your free credit balance, and will deliver to you fully paid securities held on your behalf. Interest will be charged on any debit balance; the method of calculating interest is described in a letter sent to all margin customers. J.P. MORGAN FUNDS OR THIRD PARTY FUNDS Shares of the funds referenced above are not bank deposits and are not guaranteed by any bank, government entity, or the FDIC. Return and share price will fluctuate and redemption value may be more or less than original cost. The estimated annual income and dividend yield figures for mutual funds represent the funds\\' most recent income dividend annualized. You could lose money by investing in a Money Market Fund. With respect to a Money Market Fund that qualifies as a \"retail\" or \"government\" money market fund under applicable money market fund regulations, although the Money Market Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. In the case of a Money Market Fund that does not qualify as a \"retail\" or \"government\" money market fund, because the share price of the Money Market Fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. If a Money Market Fund does not qualify as a \"government\" money market fund the Money Market Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Money Market Fund\\'s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in a Money Market Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. A Money Market Fund\\'s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. Additional information about J.P. Morgan Funds fees is available in the J.P. Morgan Funds Disclosure Statement and in prospectuses that you may obtain from JPMorgan Distribution Services, Inc., for the J.P. Morgan Funds by calling 800.480.4111 (Mutual Funds), 844.457.6383 (ETFs), or by visiting www.jpmorganfunds.com, and for the Six Circles Funds, by calling 212.464.2070. Additional information about third party fund fees is available in the Third Party Funds Disclosure Statement. Additional information, and a prospectus for any Registered Fund in your account, may be obtained by contacting your J.P. Morgan representative team. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MUTUAL FUNDS AND EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS REGISTERED UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (\"REGISTERED FUNDS\") (i) J.P. Morgan Funds - Management Fees J.P. Morgan or its affiliates may be sponsors or managers of Registered Funds (\"J.P. Morgan Funds\") that are purchased for the Client\\'s Portfolio. In such case, J.P. Morgan or its affiliates may receive a fee for managing the J.P. Morgan Funds. As such, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates will receive more total revenue when the Client\\'s Portfolio is invested in J.P. Morgan Funds than when it is invested in third party funds. (ii) J.P. Morgan Funds and Third Party Funds - Other Fees & Expenses All Registered Funds have various internal fees and other expenses that are paid by managers or issuers of the Registered Funds or by the Registered Fund itself, but that ultimately are borne by the investor. J.P. Morgan may receive administrative, servicing and other fees for providing services to both J.P. Morgan Funds and third party Registered Funds that are held in the Client\\'s Portfolio. These payments may be made by sponsors of Registered Funds (including affiliates of J.P. Morgan) or by the Registered Funds themselves, and may be based on the value of the Registered Funds in the Client\\'s Portfolio. Registered Funds or their sponsors may have other business relationships with J.P. Morgan outside of its portfolio management role or with the broker-dealer affiliates of J.P. Morgan, which may provide brokerage or other services that pay commissions, fees and other compensation. (iii) Six Circles Funds The Six Circles Funds are Registered Funds specifically designed by J.P. Morgan for use in discretionary accounts as completion funds to align with J.P. Morgan\\'s core portfolio views. A J.P. Morgan affiliate acts as investment advisor to the Six Circles Funds and engages third-party investment managers as sub-advisors to the Funds\\' investment portfolios. J.P. Morgan may',\n",

       " \"\\x0cFor the Period 8/1/20 to 8/31/20 experience certain benefits and efficiencies from investing account assets in the Six Circles Funds instead of unaffiliated investment vehicles; however, J.P. Morgan does not retain investment advisory fees for managing the Six Circles Funds through an agreement to waive any investment advisory fees that exceed the fees owed to the Six Circles Funds' third-party sub-advisors. The Six Circles Funds do not pay fees to J.P. Morgan for any other services to the Six Circles Funds. Services are provided by third-party service providers and are generally paid by the Six Circles Funds or J.P. Morgan. (Note that the market value of assets invested in the Six Circles Funds will be included in calculating the advisory fees paid on the overall Portfolio.) Periodic reviews of mutual fund investments held in client accounts are undertaken to determine if you can access better pricing on your J.P. Morgan and third party mutual fund positions for which J.P. Morgan provides ongoing due diligence services. As a result of these reviews, we may identify share classes that have lower fees than those in which you are currently invested. Where such share classes are available, under the terms of your custody with Brokerage account(s), you have the option at any time to instruct us to convert your current positions into share classes with lower fees. Please note: Depending on your tax residence and status, there may be tax implications associated with converting your position(s). As such, we recommend you discuss this matter with your independent professional tax adviser prior to taking any action.\",\n",
